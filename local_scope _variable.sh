# GLOBAL VARIABLE: Defined outside functions and can be read or modified from anywhere in the entire script.
# LOCAL VARIABLE: Declared with the 'local' keyword inside a function and disappears completely once that function finishes.
# FUNCTION INVOCATION: Triggered simply by writing the function's name on a line, without using parentheses like in other languages.
